# 1786-voting-simulator
Just a fun little voting simulator I made while teaching myself python

### Steps to take the quiz:
1. Copy the code from the [.py file](https://github.com/yusuf-zain/1786-voting-simulator/blob/master/1786-voting-simulator.py)
2. Paste it into any python interpreter (i.e. pycharm or anything off the internet)
3. Have fun taking this historical quiz
